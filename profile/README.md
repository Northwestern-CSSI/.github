Science Takes a Leap Inward
The Center for Science of Science & Innovation (CSSI) is the first center world-wide dedicated to the field of the science of science. The center builds on Kelloggâ€™s long-standing tradition of excellence in this field and helps bring together faculty and students across Kellogg and Northwestern to further and cement our global thought leadership position in the field. A multidisciplinary community by nature, CSSI also serves as the nexus to bring together thought leaders in closely related fields such as computational social science, network science and artificial intelligence.

CSSI collaborators take scientific methods and turn them upon science itself to establish a systematic, quantitative framework that can make sense of mass quantities of data and identify emerging patterns. Armed with big data spanning all phases of scientific production, a defining feature of our work is a mechanistic approach to developing models that can uncover fundamental patterns in science. By combining our diverse expertise and approaches, the results of this center will lead to a qualitative shift in the way knowledge is discovered, science is funded, scientists are trained and nurtured, and excellence is recognized and rewarded.
